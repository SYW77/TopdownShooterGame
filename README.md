## 🎮Project Overview
This game is about avoiding enemy attacks that are generated and killing enemies using shooting attacks.
<br>

## 🕹️How to Play
1. Enemies spawn at random locations, faster as time passes.
2. Enemies chase the player and inflict damage.
3. Player must move to avoid enemies and kill them with shooting attacks.
4. The game ends when the HP gauge reaches 0.
5. Survive as long as possible!

## 🧑‍💻My Own Update
1. Allows continuous damage to be taken while in contact with the enemy.
2. Makes enemies unable to damage player for 1 second after spawning.

## 📝Updates Planned
